## AES128 GCM Block Cipher ##

1. **Implementation of AES 128 block cipher** based on the FIPS standards. The code was written in C and the program passed successfully all tests.

2. **Integration of Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)** into implemented AES 128 cipher, which resulted in a fully operational aes 128 gcm encryption and data integrity solution, similar to one installed into a modern day browser, when secure connection is needed.
